lambda-learner
==============

A GUI tool to aid with learning the lambda calculus.

* Requirements

This program was written using reactive-banana and reactive-banana-wx version 0.8.0 as well
as a supported wxwidgets development package. Currently, it seems that reactive-banana-wx only supports 
wxwidgets 2.9.

* Building

This program should compile using GHC with the -XRankNTypes flag.
